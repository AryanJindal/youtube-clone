## debouncing 
- slow typer ==> made api calls for each and every key stroke
- fast typer ==> made API calls after some particular duration ==> do not going to need much suggestions

Debouncing with 200ms ==> means if diff b/w two key strokes if 200ms or less, then decline the API call, else make an API call and show the results because user has stopped typing and might need the results now.
